            <h1>A. Definition and Criteria.</h1>
              <p>1. Definition. A Genhu drop-in center is a building modeled and furnished for the refuge, hygiene, feeding, and training of street children. It is strategically located in urban or suburban regions within safe walking access of children. These are homes provide food, shelter, clothes, bathrooms which include showers, tutoring for school, psychological services, cultural preservation and creativity, and legal services where warranted. The only difference between an orphanage and a drop center is that a child does not sleep at the latter. A child “drops in” regularly on weekdays to receive these services. Children are registered beforehand. On occasion, nonregistered hungry children in the street are permitted to drop in for a meal. Every determination is made to confirm they qualify and that they do not have parents seeking to take advantage of the system. Starving children are not turned away and a small slush fund is maintained for this purpose.</p>
              <p>2. Criteria. If a child fulfills any 3 of the following 5 criteria, they qualify for registration:</p>
                <ol type="I" class ="tab">
                  <li>They have one or zero parents (the United Nations definition of an orphan).</li>
                  <li>They have a dirt floor in their home, or they sleep on the floor.</li>
                  <li>They are not formally matriculated into the public school system.</li>
                  <li>Our meal will be the only meal they eat that day.</li>
                  <li>They are victims of armed conflict or internally displaced persons.</li>
                </ol>

        <div className="mid-drop-content-full">
          <h1>E. Operations.</h1>
          <p>These homes are operated as Genhu homes, even though local nonprofits may operate or facilitate the services. Record are kept as follows:</p>
            <ol class="tab">
              <li>Number of children and meals served each day.</li>
              <li>Financial accountability including receipts and running statements of revenue and expenditures. This includes local donations of food or other in-kind items.</li>
              <li>Activities provided by strategic partners such as matriculation of children, medical attention, legal services, parental training, training against domestic violence, drug and sex trafficking,</li>
              <li>Religious activities. Genhu operates homes in Latin America. These are Christian nations, dominated by the Catholic faith. Christian themes are permitted, and the children say grace before each meal, but no particular religion is endorsed and proselytizing is not permitted by any faith. The exception to this rule are our orphanages co-operated by nuns.</li>
              <li>Social Media. Each home is to have a representative that publishes photos of the activities on the Genhu Facebook page as well as submit them to headquarters for the general website. Home staff should be careful to maintain branding of Genhu in all posts and to minimize local participation except as strategic partners. This is done to increase Genhu branding and donations, as well as minimize confusion to donors. Further, care should be taken to publish photos of individual children. They are not to be tagged or identified by name in the photos for their protection. In some cases, guardians should give written permission to publish activity photos at the home.</li>

                        <li>Continental breakfast. This snack consists of bread, croissant, or arepa and butter and jam. Fruit in season and juice are also provided. On occasion an egg is provided, based upon availability and budget at the home.</li>

            <h1>I. Formal Schooling.</h1>
            <p>Children are to attend public school. If the guardian is unable to provide costs of matriculation, Genhu will pay these costs separately from monthly operational budgets, if no local foundation can be found to support the child. The children are to have adequate uniforms required by the school and they should be equal in quality to other children who have means in order to minimize bullying or mocking of the poor child. In many cases, children are one or more grades behind their age group. Genhu will also pay for school supplies and provide tutoring at the home. Historically, our children often catch up and even excel their fellow classmates.</p>

          <h1>J. Costs.</h1>
          <p>The budget for each home is calculated based upon nutritional needs, number of children registered, and volunteer versus paid staff.</p>
            <ol class="tab">
              <li>Volunteer costs. Each home is to have a minimum of 10 regular volunteers. They are to receive a Genhu shirt and travel expenses if necessary. They may also eat lunch with the children on the days they volunteer at no cost to them.</li>
              <li>Gardens, micro-enterprise, health clinics, and other approved projects will have budgets separate from the monthly operational budget.</li>
              <li>Local governments are to provide between 10 – 25 percent of the food costs. The home director is responsible for securing this participation as well as seek food donations from local vendors.</li>
              <li>The average monthly expense for each child ranges from $15 – $21 per child. This takes the monthly deposit (food, salaries, utilities, etc.) and divides it by the number of children registered at each home. Budgets for each home are determined on a case by case basis through a process of consultation with local donors, home directors, local government participation, and needs of the community.</li>
