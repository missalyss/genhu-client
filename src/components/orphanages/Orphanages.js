        <div className="mid-p">Generations Humanitarian is committed to transform street children toward an abundance of health, hope, and loving homesâ€”thereby breaking the cycle of scarcity for generations to come. This is done through broad research, novel development, strengthening nonprofit entities in development, and individual nurturing in a home environment. Our orphanages are helping improve the lives of hundreds of children by providing them with food, clothing, shelter, and the opportunity to find their forever families through our adoption programs.</div>

        <div className="mid-para2">Just 45 minutes west of Cusco, the is snuggled against a hillside in the town of Izcuchaca. Founded by a Catholic nun decades ago, it is home to about 25 girls or have been orphaned or abandoned. In addition many children who attend elementary school in Izcuchaca live in the surrounding villages atop the mountains surrounding the home. The nuns feed these children lunch (school lunch is not provided) as they leave school to return to their homes. Some of them live a 1-2 hour hike away and have had nothing to eat all day. These children live in improverish peasant homes made of adobe and dirt floors.

The bishop of the local diocese donates approximately $300 USD monthly, and Generations Humanitarian pays the rest. The home is run by three nuns, who love and care for the children and are very frugal.

The has a basketball/volleyball court, two greenhouses, classrooms, a multipurpose room, kitchen, laundry area (done by hand), and dorms.

Beginning in 2017, we are launching an education fund for the full time residents of the home. This includes private education, technical trade such as making pottery and ceramics, and university scholarships.
